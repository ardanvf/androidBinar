### Challenge 6 - Binar Academy

This is a sample project which demonstrates how to create infinite lists with Paging 3 library using modern Android Architecture Components(Kotlin, kotlin coroutines, MVVM, Paging 3 Library, Navigatiom Room, ViewModel).



### TheMovieDb API key

This app uses the [TheMovieDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to load movies on the main
screen. To use the API, you will need to obtain a free developer API key. See the
[TheMovieDb API Documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) for instructions.

Once you have the key, add this line to the `gradle.properties` file, either in your user home
directory (usually `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` on Linux and Mac) or in the project's root folder:

```
api_key=<your TheMovieDb API key>
base_url=https://api.themoviedb.org/3/
```

Libraries Used
--------------
* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  * [Room][16] - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
    asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Animations & Transitions][31] - Move widgets and transition between screens.
  * [Fragment][34] - A basic unit of composable UI.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
  * [Paging 3][5] - For implementing paging
* Third party and miscellaneous libraries
  * [Glide][90] for image loading
  * [Dagger 2][3] for [Dependency Injection][4]
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
